# Project Roadmap: Valence

## 1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**

- Define the scope, goals, and specifications of the project.
- Understand the hardware capabilities (FPGA, Raspberry Pi, sensors) and software requirements (C++, image processing algorithms, GUI).
- Define key performance metrics and goals (e.g., real-time tracking, accuracy).

## 2. **System Design and Architecture Planning:**

- Outline the overall system design, ensuring hardware-agnostic architecture.
- Design interfaces for image processing, communication, and sensor integration.
- Plan how different components (FPGA, Raspberry Pi, sensors) will interact.

## 3. **Development of Core Modules:**

- Implement core functionalities one at a time:
  - **Image Processing:** Develop and test basic image processing algorithms.
  - **Communication:** Establish communication protocols between devices.
  - **Sensor Integration:** Ensure compatibility and functionality with different sensors.
- Maintain hardware-agnostic design by using interfaces and abstractions.

## 4. **Prototyping and Iterative Development:**

- Build a physical prototype integrating core functionalities.
- Test the system iteratively, making refinements as needed.

## 5. **Testing and Validation:**

- Conduct thorough testing (unit tests, integration tests, and system tests).
- Validate that the system meets performance metrics and goals.

## 6. **User Interface and Usability:**

- Develop any necessary user interfaces for monitoring or control.
- Ensure usability and ease of installation.

## 7. **Optimization and Fine-Tuning:**

- Optimize algorithms for performance, accuracy, and resource utilization.
- Ensure that the system can scale and is extensible.
  
## 8. **Documentation and Code Cleanup:**

- Document code, architecture, and setup instructions comprehensively.
- Perform code cleanup, refactoring, and ensure coding standards are met.

## 9. **Deployment and Real-world Testing:**

- Deploy the system in a real-world scenario for further testing.
- Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## 10. **Continuous Improvement and Maintenance:**

- Continuously monitor, update, and improve the system based on feedback and advancements in technology.
- Ensure ongoing support and maintenance.
